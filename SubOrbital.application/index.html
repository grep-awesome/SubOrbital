		<li>I advise you to backup "/var/luna/preferences/launcher3" just in case the worst happens. This is where
		SubOrbital makes its changes. If SubOrbital does screw up you system, restoring the original contents of this folder
		will fix the problem.</li>
		<li>This app can screw up your system. It is very unlikely, but it is possible. Be aware.

		<li>Changes made by this app require a Luna restart to show up.</li>

	<h2> FAQ</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>What do you mean it can screw up my system?</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				SubOrbital does its thing by editing files in "/var/luna/preferences/launcher3". Those
				files are key to the Launcher on webOS to work correctly. If SubOrbital goes postal,
				<strong>it will not brick your device</strong>, but it can prevent it from working until you
				hash out those files. My strong suggestion is to back them up.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Why can't I edit the default tabs?</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The launcher doesn't really respect its config files. It only partially respects them.
				To know the real answer, you'd have to ask the webOS guys.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Why doesn't my tab save / what characters are valid?</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
				If you try to name a tab with anything other than alpha-numberi characters (also - and _), it will not save.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<li>I got an error Dialog! What now?</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Error dialogs here are a good thing. It means SubOrbital
			caught the error and likely didn't do damage. On the other hand
			SubOrbital probably didn't do what you asked it to either. An error
			log will be placed in /media/internal/SubOrbital_error/. If you'd kindly
			send that to me on precentral (hiddenpremise) or post it on the official
			thread for the app, I'll try to track down and fix the issue.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Your interface is ugly!</li>
		<ul>
			<li>So is your face... But really, yes, I know it isn't pretty.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>I need help!</li>
		<ul>
			<li>I'm usually happy to work with folks on the forums or irc, however you may need to be patient. 
			This is a hobby of mine that you freely benefit from. Keep
			that in mind when we speak ;). The quickest fix for any problem is to restore
			the backup that I reccomend you make and do a luna restart.
			There is no warranty express or implied for this software.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>I'd like the source code please.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>You've already got it. "ar -x com.whitm.suborbital_X.X.X.ipk" where the x's are the version number.</li>
